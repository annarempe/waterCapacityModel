	â€¢	Using only simulations for 1980-2010 for training, predict the yields for a field for 2011-2015 using only weather* information. Repeat the same using 1990-2010, or 2000-2010. 

*Consider weather to include all of the in-season variables, as well as the value of H which reflects pre-season weather that sets the initial conditions for the season.
